## About Me

> *"Try again. Fail again. Fail better."* - Samuel Beckett

I consider myself a proactive, responsible, and collaborative team member. My quick learning abilities, autonomy, persistence, and stress resistance are qualities that colleagues have frequently observed in my work. My experience revolves around rapidly grasping complex systems, particularly those involving people and problem-solving. I excel in making things happen and maintaining team momentum, though I thrive more in dynamic environments than in rigid bureaucratic settings. I firmly believe that innovation often requires taking calculated risks, as reflected in my philosophy of "Fail Fast" and "Fail Better."
