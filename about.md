## About Me

> “Try again. Fail again. Fail better” by Samuel Beckett


I consider myself a proactive person, responsible, and also a good teammate.
Quick learning, autonomy , persistence , and resistance to stress are characteristics that people have noticed most when working with me.
My experience has been oriented towards a fast understanding of systems, mostly focused on people and problem-solving. I think I am good
at making things happen and keeping things moving within the team, but I am probably not the right person for hard bureaucratic processes
or very strict environments. I always have in mind that nobody can make an omelet without breaking an egg , so I'd say that "Fail Fast" and "Fail
Better" are probably two quotes that might describe me well.
